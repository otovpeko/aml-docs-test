<h1>Whoops! 404!</h1>

<p>So it's like this: either I broke something on the site, or you messed up the URL.
Try the navigation panel {% if site.search_enabled != false %}or search {% endif %}to find what you're
looking for or go to <a href="{{ '/' | absolute_url }}">home page</a>. Also, contact a technical writer about this.</p>
