## AML Knowledge Base

### Long-term Docs Migration

If you can see this paragraph, the migration is still going. We are moving all the docs here in an orderly manner. At some point in the future there won't be any documents in Confluence. Right now they all should have disclaimers about those pages being obsolete, and new docs being here. If you find a Confluence document that doesn't have a link to this site, please be sure to inform a technical writer.

### Navigating the Knowledge base

We are trying to make the site as simple and intuitive as can be. If you have suggestions about navigation, feel free to contact the Techwriter.

Check the navigation bar to the left. Some of the items are dropdown menus that allow you to select product version, or something else.
